Created for VITMAV45 course as the third mid-term assignment.

The given task was building a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) which can predict the average temperature at Budapest in 3 given date.

The dates were 2020.10.28; 2020.11.03; and 2020.11.24.

The datas for the neural network training were collected from this source: [here](http://idojarasbudapest.hu/archivalt-idojaras)

The datacollection was made by hand, saved in an CSV file. This contains two columns, the first the temperature collections dates and the second with the average temperatures for the specific days. It can be found in the repository.
